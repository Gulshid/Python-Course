# Relational Operator
# ==, <, >, !=, >=, <=,

x = 2, y = 4

# Equality ==
x == y # value of x equal y

x = 2 # with name x ===> location in memory ===> stored 2

# Less than <
# x < y ===> # check the value of x less than y 


# greater than >
# x > y ===> # check the value of x greater than y

# Not equal to !=
# x != y ==> # check the value of x is not equal to y

# greater or equal to >=
# x >= y ===> # check the value of x is greater than or equal to y

# less than or equal to <=
# x <= y ===> # check the value of x is less than or equal to y
